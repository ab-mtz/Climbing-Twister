Small personal project to play "Twister" like on a climbing wall (Spray wall: means different grips of different colors).
Esentially a random generator to select Limb and color. Compared to a normal Twister-spinner wich only has two colors, this has 9 colors
found in the Spray wall of my climbing gym.
